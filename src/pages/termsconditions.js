            Subscription period
          </h1>
          The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a
          paid Subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
          periodic basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually), depending
          on the type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the
          Subscription.
          <br />
          At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew
          under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the Company
          cancels it.
          <br />
          <h1 className="text-2xl font-extrabold text-black sm:text-center sm:text-4xl">
            Subscription cancellations
          </h1>
          <br />
          You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account
          settings page or by contacting the Company. You will not receive a
          refund for the fees You already paid for Your current Subscription
          period and You will be able to access the Service until the end of
          Your current Subscription period.
          <br />
          If the Subscription has been made through an In-app Purchase, You can
          cancel the renewal of Your Subscription with the Application Store.
          <br />

            Billing
          </h1>
          <br />
          You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing
          information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone
          number, and a valid payment method information.
          <br />
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company
          will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed
          manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
          corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
          <br />
          If the Subscription has been made through an In-app Purchase, all
          billing is handled by the Application Store and is governed by the
          Application Store’s own terms and conditions.

            Fee Changes
          </h1>
          <br />
          The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
          Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become effective
          at the end of the then-current Subscription period.
          <br />
          The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any
          change in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to terminate
          Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
          <br />
          Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change
          comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified
          Subscription fee amount.

            Refunds
          </h1>
          <br />
          Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are
          non-refundable.
          <br />
          Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the
          Company on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of
          the Company.
          <br />
          If the Subscription has been made through an In-app purchase, the
          Application Store’s refund policy will apply. If You wish to request a
          refund, You may do so by contacting the Application Store directly.

            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
            the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
            indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
            limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
            information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
            privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or
            inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or
            third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in
            connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or
            any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and
            even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
            limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
            which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In
            these states, each party&quot;s liability will be limited to the
            greatest extent permitted by law.

            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
